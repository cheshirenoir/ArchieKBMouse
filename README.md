# ArchieKBMouse
An adapter to allow Archimedes computers to use cheap PS/2 keyboards and mice. This is just a PCB/Schematic based on the hard work of the StarDot forum.
Based on a design by IanB, with some additional decoding by IanS

All I have done is put IanB's work into KiCAD, and designed a PCB off it, using some hinting from the schematic by IanS, so all credit and right belong to them.
